                <h2>Greetings</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you are on this page that means you want to know more information about me. First, I am a dedicated father 
                        who loves to spend time with his child. I enjoy lifting weights and staying active by any means. 
                        Suprisingly, after I obtained my bachelors in chemistry I discovered that I also have a passion for technology. 
                        I've never attended a bootcamp before so all the knowledge I have has been acquired through my own means in my spare time. 
                        I think the beauty of being a self-taught developer is learning more about myself as I venture into this new world. 
                        I've learned the areas in which I excel and the areas in which I need improvement, on a personal level. 
                        This type of personal development is priceless because I can apply these skills to any aspect in life. 
                        Learning new languages for web development/programming and practicing the ones I already know has become a fullfilling
                        hobby. I think one of the most fascinating aspects about web devlopment is the vast amount of material one can learn.
                        I find it hard to be bored of something that is seemingly never ending. 
                    </p>
